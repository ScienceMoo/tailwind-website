        <br></br>Q) How is your face always in the centre?
        <br></br>A) I stabilized each photo manually, frame by frame (notice how the borders are always moving?). It took me around 50+ hours in total for this video. I posted a video explaining the process in detail here: https://youtu.be/FGXGHYonfGM?t=2m16s<br></br>

        <br></br>Q) Why don't you smile?
        <br></br>A) Mainly for consistency. From the beginning, I planned to have the same expression in every photo, and it's easier to keep a straight face than it is to smile in the same way each time. Secondly, I wanted to capture the physical changes in my face, while avoiding the emotional changes in my life. <br></br>

        <br></br>Q) Why did you start? What gave you the idea?
        <br></br>A) In 2008, I watched Noah Kalina's project here on YouTube, and I decided to start my own that focuses on myself aging, since I was still young at the time. I was also motivated by wanting to document my life, and to be able to show this to my family in the future.<br></br>

        <br></br>Q) Do you plan to keep going forever? Will you ever stop?
        <br></br>A) I have no intention of stopping. The plan is to continue this project forever.<br></br>

        <br></br>Q) Where are you from?
        <br></br>A) I was born in London, England, but have spent most of my life in Canada. I'm currently living in Fredericton, Canada.<br></br>

        <br></br>Q) How old were you when you were married?
        <br></br>A) I was 21, but turned 22 less than a month later.<br></br>
